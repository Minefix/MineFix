# MineFix

MineFix is a project that tries to recreate [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) in [Minetest](https://minetest.net), as close to Minecraft as possible. It does this by adding new mods that supply missing blocks and items, recreate game mechanics (hunger, experience, enchanting, etc), and removing non-Minecraft features from the base Minetest game.

Note that we are **not** trying to be compatible with existing mods and modpacks. Mods will have to be made compatible with this subgame instead.

Join the development on #minefix on Snoonet (IRC), or [#minefix:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#minefix:matrix.org) (Matrix)!

Please note that MineFix is still in early stages of development and is subject to changes. Textures displayed in the screenshots are generated by the conversion script provided, paid copy of minecraft is required as those textures aren't included with the subgame.

## Installation instructions

Copy or clone this repository to `~/.minetest/games/minefix` (make sure there isn't a minefix folder inside a minefix folder).
Make sure you run a copy of Minetest compiled after the 22nd of March. The stable build lacks features we require, so you'll have to compile from source for now.

Edit the convert-mc-to-mt script to properly reflect how Minetest and Minecraft are both located on your system and then run it.

Once installed, select the Minefix subgame and the Minecraft texture pack, create a world, and start playing!
